# Spawn Points Teleport

## ⚠️ Unfortunately this does not work on the Steam version of the game, only Epic version is supported.

Outer Wilds mod for teleporting to spawn points.

Install the mod with the [Outer Wilds Mod Manager](https://outerwildsmods.com/mod-manager/). After installing, you should see a new entry in the pause menu ("Teleport to..."). Select the destination from the list.

You can save the last selected teleport location to be the initial spawn point after you die. This will be saved even if you close the game.
